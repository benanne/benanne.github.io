Yesterday, I gave talk at the [Deep Learning London Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Deep-Learning-London/events/183804302/) about my [PhD research](http://benanne.github.io/research/) and [my approach](http://benanne.github.io/2014/04/05/galaxy-zoo.html) to winning the [Galaxy Zoo challenge on Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge). The slides for my talk are available for download:

* [Download the slides in PDF format **(16MB)**](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19706734/music_galaxies.pdf)
* [Download the slides in PPTX format **(82MB)**](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19706734/music_galaxies.pptx)

The three papers I discussed in the first part of the talk are described [here](http://benanne.github.io/research/), download links to the PDFs are included. A detailed description of my solution for the Galaxy Challenge is available in [an earlier post on this blog](http://benanne.github.io/2014/04/05/galaxy-zoo.html). The code for all 17 models included in the winning ensemble is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/benanne/kaggle-galaxies).
