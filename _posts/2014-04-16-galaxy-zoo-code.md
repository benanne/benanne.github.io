[Some two weeks ago](http://benanne.github.io/2014/04/05/galaxy-zoo.html) I posted about my solution for the [Galaxy Zoo challenge](http://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge) on Kaggle. Today I've [published the code with documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/benanne/kaggle-galaxies).

Get it here:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone git://github.com/benanne/kaggle-galaxies.git
{% endhighlight %}

Have a look at the `README` file for instructions on how to generate the winning solution, or check out `doc/documentation.pdf` for more information. 

The code is available under a BSD 3-clause licence. If you've found it useful, dropping me a line to let me know how you used it is appreciated. Have fun with it!
